# Practice---Learn-Javascript-Journey
Javascript, the language of our browsers is one of the most popular programming languages in the world so I decided to deepen my skills in the language, first reviewing beginner knowledge that I have been exposed to and later more advanced topics in Javascript.

This repository is a **Practice Repository** and will primarily include follow alongs from tutorials on the internet and vanilla javascript projects. Tutorials will be organized in folders based on when they are done and will be titled by the name of the tutorial.

## Tutorials Covered:
1. JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners - Traversy Media (from Youtube)

## Projects Featured
1. Color Flipper : changes the backround of html body on click of button. Good introductory project for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
